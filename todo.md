- Get for loop working again on COL API (in order to do all cities dynamically instead of just the first).

- Generate and copy JSON from back end into front end in case Heroku has problems during presentation.
- Call JSON from back end and display in front end.
- Clean up API stuff and data in front end that were moved to back end.
- Deploy to firebase and send links e-mail to Nmuta.

- In main controller, iterate through my JSON object to match data against user prefs. Use separate function for each category, then use one master function to call them all.

- Make it Tinder style with cards. On swipe right, it goes into a container to be reviewed later. Swipe left, and it's gone.

- Final testing, cleanup, tweaking, and look/feel.
