    Pull API data and save locally on app load. Use separate function for each API/set of APIs, and use master function to call them all.
    On prefs save, parse saved API data and match with prefs. 
- T: Make it Tinder style with cards. On swipe right, it goes into a container to be reviewed later. Swipe left, and it's gone.
