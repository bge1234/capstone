- F-M: Write matching algorithm (output results as list). Triggered/retriggered by a button. Use separate function to pull data from each API/set of APIs, parse it, and then match it with relevant prefs.
- T: Make it Tinder style with cards. On swipe right, it goes into a container to be reviewed later. Swipe left, and it's gone.
