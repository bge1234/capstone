- F/weekend:
  Remove "projects" portions and save prefs directly.
  Make it so only one set of pref saves and gets overwritten with new ones.
  Write matching algorithm (output results as list). Triggered/retriggered by a button.

- M: Clean up CSS/look and feel (more like a phone). Use ng-cloak. Separation of concerns for Angular items.
- T: Make it Tinder style with cards. Swipe right, it goes into a container to be reviewed later. Swipe left, and it's gone.
