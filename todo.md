Sunday and Monday:
  - Salary and COL APIs.
  - Save incoming data somewhere in service.
  - Test in iOS emulator to make sure CORS isn't an issue. Fix it if it is.
  - Back in main controller, parse saved data to match against user prefs. Use separate function for each API/set of APIs, and use master function to call them all.
Tuesday: Make it Tinder style with cards. On swipe right, it goes into a container to be reviewed later. Swipe left, and it's gone.
