    <p>Note: This is a mobile app.  The best way to view it is to use Google Chrome's dev tools (Hamburger icon > More Tools > Developer Tools) and then click on the two rectangles icon to the left of "Elements".  This will force the app to display approximately as it would on a phone, save for a few things which are unique to phones.</p>

    <p><strong>Here is the actual homepage of the app: <a href="www/index.html">https://moveit-benebel.firebaseapp.com/www/index.html</a></strong></p>
