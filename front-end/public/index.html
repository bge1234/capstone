    <p>Note: This is a mobile app.  The best way to view it is to use Google Chrome's dev tools (hamburger icon > More Tools > Developer Tools) and then click on the two rectangles icon to the left of "Elements".  This will force the app to display approximately as it would on a phone, save for a few things which are unique to phones.</p>
